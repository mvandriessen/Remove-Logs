# Remove-Logs
This function will delete all files older than a certain number of days.

You have the ability to specify log path, extension (log, etl or txt) and path.

Log path and extension are optional. If no log path is specified, no log (CSV) will be written. You will still get feedback on what's happening on the screen

You do not have to specify the extension. When left empty, all files older than the cutoff date will be deleted.
